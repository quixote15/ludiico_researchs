Abstract = {{Chatbots have rapidly become a mainstay in software development. A range
   of chatbots contribute regularly to the creation of actual production
   software. It is somewhat difficult, however, to precisely delineate hype
   from reality. Questions arise as to what distinguishes a chatbot from an
   ordinary software tool, what might be desirable properties of chatbots,
   and where their future may lie. This position paper introduces a
   starting framework through which we examine the current state of
   chatbots and identify directions for future work.}},

Abstract = {{kappa-labs is a research project exploring the possibilities of the
   logic programming paradigm in bot behavior programming for first-person
   shooter (FPS) games. The focus of previous work was to make Prolog a
   usable tool for bot programming and a baseline for further extensions.
   This paper presents one such extension, which makes it possible to
   script tactics of the entire team of bots. The algorithm was tested by
   bot-to-bot computer tests and by running surveys among human players who
   volunteered to take part in the research. The results of the both tests
   are presented in this paper. The extension itself demonstrates the
   flexibility of the framework. Although the proposed method for defining
   team behaviors relies solely on the knowledge of the bot's designer,
   alternative approaches, which use rules that are obtained by
   computational techniques, can also be developed. Such approaches are
   also being investigated as part of the kappa-labs project.}},

Abstract = {{Chatbots are emerging as the newest platform used by millions of
   consumers worldwide due in part to the commoditization of natural
   language services, which provide provide developers with many building
   blocks to create chatbots inexpensively. However, it is still difficult
   to build and deploy chatbots. Developers need to handle the coordination
   of the cognitive services to build the chatbot interface, integrate the
   chatbot with external services, and worry about extensibility,
   scalability, and maintenance. In this work, we present the architecture
   and prototype of a chatbot using a serverless platform, where developers
   compose stateless functions together to perform useful actions. We
   describe our serverless architecture based on function sequences, and
   how we used these functions to coordinate the cognitive microservices in
   the Watson Developer Cloud to allow the chatbot to interact with
   external services. The serverless model improves the extensibility of
   our chatbot, which currently supports 6 abilities: location based
   weather reports, jokes, date, reminders, and a simple music tutor.}},

abstract={Despite the fact that all Turing's premises were completely fulfilled long ago and that a lot of effort has been made towards the invention of a high-quality conversation imitator, there is still no chatterbot capable of passing the Turing test. Presumably, the greatest deficiency is the use of the pattern matching approach and consequently, the disregard of more profound linguistic analysis. Recent developments in computing enable the creation of high-quality chatterbots with an excellent linguistic background. This paper proposes a conceptual framework for such a system and points out further directions towards the improvement of its non-intellectual abilities according to current software trends.},

abstract={Automated task planning for service robots faces great challenges in handling dynamic domestic environments. Classical methods in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) area mostly focus on relatively structured environments with fewer uncertainties. This work proposes a method to combine semantic knowledge representation with classical approaches in AI to build a flexible framework that can assist service robots in task planning at the high symbolic level. A semantic knowledge ontology is constructed for representing two main types of information: environmental description and robot primitive actions. Environmental knowledge is used to handle spatial uncertainties of particular objects. Primitive actions, which the robot can execute, are constructed based on a STRIPS-style structure, allowing a feasible solution (an action sequence) for a particular task to be created. With the Care-O-Bot (CoB) robot as the platform, we explain this work with a simple, but still challenging, scenario named �get a milk box�. A recursive back-trace search algorithm is introduced for task planning, where three main components are involved, namely primitive actions, world states, and mental actions. The feasibility of the work is demonstrated with the CoB in a simulated environment.},

abstract={There is an urgent need for a pro-active approach to botnet detection and mitigation that will enable computer network defenders to characterize emerging and future botnet threats and design effective defense techniques before these threats materialize. To this end, we have developed a system for live investigation of next generation bots (SLINGbot). SLINGbot is an extensible, composable bot framework that enables researchers to construct benign bots for the purposes of generating and characterizing botnet command and control (C2) traffic. This enables researchers to simulate current and potential future botnet traffic, characterize it, and design effective defense techniques. In this paper, we describe the SLINGbot system and how it can be used for the pro-active development of botnet defenses.},

abstract={The continued growth of the Internet has resulted in the increasing sophistication of toolkit and methods to conduct computer attacks and intrusions that are easy to use and publicly available to download, such as Zeus botnet toolkit. Botnets are responsible for many cyber-attacks, such as spam, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), identity theft, and phishing. Most of existence botnet toolkits release updates for new features, development and support. This presents challenges in the detection and prevention of bots. Current botnet detection approaches mostly ineffective as botnets change their Command and Control (C&amp;C) server structures, centralized (e.g., IRC, HTTP), distributed (e.g., P2P), and encryption deterrent. In this paper, based on real world data sets we present our preliminary research on predicting the new bots before they launch their attack. We propose a rich set of features of network traffic using Classification of Network Information Flow Analysis (CONIFA) framework to capture regularities in C&amp;C communication channels and malicious traffic. We present a case study of applying the approach to a popular botnet toolkit, Zeus. The experimental evaluation suggest that it is possible to detect effectively botnets during the botnet C&amp;C communication generated from new updated Zeus botnet toolkit by building the classifier using machine learning from an earlier version and before they launch their attacks using traffic behaviors. Also, show that there is similarity in C&amp;C structures various Botnet toolkit versions and that the network characteristics of botnet C&amp;C traffic is different from legitimate network traffic. Such methods could reduce many different resources needed to identify C&amp;C communication channels and malicious traffic.},
